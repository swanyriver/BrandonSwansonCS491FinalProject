For this assignment I continued the development of the Youtube Snippet Playlist application that I developed in earlier assignments.  The backend makes use of the Google App Engine Platform-as-a-Service,  and uses their NDB set of classes to save and retrieve entities in a non-relational database.
There is both a mobile native (Android application) and an HTML rendering front end available for these entities.  Conforming to RESTful principles the entities in the non relational database are representation agnostic, allowing the user to view the entities in a mobile application or browser.Platform Used for Mobile Development And Server RESTful Backend
